Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:\n\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     measure:\n       github: jgaskins/measure\n   ```\n\n2. Run `shards install`\n\n## Usage\n\n[API reference](https://jgaskins.dev/measure)\n\n### Length\n\nYou measure lengths with `Measure::Length`. You can either instantiate it with the constructor or the shorthand methods on `Number`:\n\n```crystal\nrequire \"measure/length\"\n\n# Both of these expressions are equivalent:\nMeasure::Length.new(50, :miles)\n50.miles\n```\n\nYou can also convert measurements to other units:\n\n```crystal\n50.miles.to(:km)\n# => Measure::Length(@magnitude=80.46719742504969, @unit=Measure::Length::Unit::Kilometer)\n10.miles.to(:feet)\n# => Measure::Length(@magnitude=52800.0, @unit=Measure::Length::Unit::Foot)\n1.foot.to(:cm)\n# => Measure::Length(@magnitude=30.47999902464003, @unit=Measure::Length::Unit::Centimeter)\n6.feet.to(:inches)\n# => Measure::Length(@magnitude=72.0, @unit=Measure::Length::Unit::Inch)\n```\n\n## Area and Volume\n\nYou can even multiply two instances of a `Measure::Length` to get a `Measure::Area`:\n\n```crystal\n3.feet * 3.feet # => Measure::Area(@magnitude=9.0, @unit=Measure::Area::Unit::SquareFoot)\n```\n\nAnd then multiply that to get a `Measure::Volume`:\n\n```crystal\n3.feet * 3.feet * 3.feet # => Measure::Volume(@magnitude=27.0, @unit=Measure::Volume::Unit::CubicFoot)\n```\n\nThe full list of length units are available [here](https://jgaskins.dev/measure/Measure/Length/Unit.html).\n\n### Weight\n\nSimilar to `Measure::Length` for length/distance measurements, we measure weights with `Measure::Weight`:\n\n```crystal\nrequire \"measure/weight\"\n\n# Both of these expressions are equivalent:\nMeasure::Weight.new(50, :pounds)\n50.pounds\n```\n\nIt also supports conversions:\n\n```crystal\n50000.grams.to(:pounds)\n# => Measure::Weight(@magnitude=110.231, @unit=Measure::Weight::Unit::Pound)\n50000.grams.to(:kilograms)\n# => Measure::Weight(@magnitude=50.0, @unit=Measure::Weight::Unit::Kilogram)\n50.grams.to(:ounces)\n# => Measure::Weight(@magnitude=1.763696, @unit=Measure::Weight::Unit::Ounce)\n```\n\n## Precision\n\nIt's important to note that this shard stores the magnitude of the measurement as a `Float64`. This means it is limited to the precision 64-bit IEEE754 floating-point numbers.\n\n### Why [`Float64`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.16.3/Float64.html) when [`BigDecimal`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.16.3/BigDecimal.html) is right there?\n\nMeasurements of nearly everything are less precise than we think they are. If you pull out a tape measure and measure something as being 10 feet long, that measurement is only as precise as your eyes, the placement of both ends of the tape, and the markings on the tape itself. It might be within 1/16th of an inch, but it's not going to be *exactly* 10 feet. Even objects measured and cut by machine are subject to the precision of that machine — they may be within 1/64th of an inch, but they won't be *exactly* 10 feet, either.\n\nThe point is that measurements just need to be close enough. `Float64` gets us close enough.\n\nThe [`spider-gazelle/crunits`](https://github.com/spider-gazelle/crunits) shard offers arbitrary precision for measurements. It's also a lot slower and doesn't offer the same compile-time guarantees that this shard does. But if you feel you need arbitrary precision, use `crunits`.\n\n<details><summary>Comparison to <code>crunits</code></summary>\n\n`crunits` is a Crystal port of the [Ruby `unitwise` gem](https://github.com/joshwlewis/unitwise).\nThe Ruby gem is _amazing_, to be clear, and the Crystal shard appears to support\nsimilar levels of flexibility and extensibility.\n\nThe reason I chose not to use it and instead write `Measure` is that `Units`\nhandles measurements as `BigDecimal` for the magnitude and `String` for the unit\nof measure. This has two primary drawbacks.\n\nThe first is that, if you use the wrong unit of measure (misspell it, for example), you can't find out until run time. So if you wrote `\"hours\"` instead of `\"hour\"`, you may not notice until that code is in production. This fits the Ruby perspective well enough, but `Measure` leans on the Crystal type system so you can detect these sorts of bugs much earlier. You can argue that you should see it work before deploying it, but let's be real, we've all screwed this up. We've YOLOed code to prod, written tests that didn't test what we thought we were testing and never saw them fail, etc. We're not perfect. If you haven't, let me know and I'll hire you.\n\nThe second is that using `BigDecimal` and `String` makes `crunits` very malleable (you don't have to patch the shard to add units, for example), but it's also significantly slower. `BigDecimal` allows arbitrary precision, but that precision has a performance cost. If you need this precision, use `crunits`. `String`s for units mean every instantiation, arithmetic operation, conversion, etc all involve string parsing. This adds a lot of overhead. On my machine, the benchmarks look like this:\n\n```\nInstantiation\ncrunits   4.84k (206.70µs) (± 1.50%)  908kB/op  245402.46× slower\nmeasure   1.19G (  0.84ns) (± 1.33%)   0.0B/op            fastest\n\nArithmetic\ncrunits   1.44M (693.46ns) (± 0.58%)  1.93kB/op  359.61× slower\nmeasure 518.57M (  1.93ns) (± 3.71%)    0.0B/op         fastest\n\nConversion\ncrunits  13.28k ( 75.30µs) (± 0.71%)  290kB/op  78776.24× slower\nmeasure   1.05G (  0.96ns) (± 1.42%)   0.0B/op           fastest\n```\n\nFor some of these, the monotonic clock is overcounting how long it takes to run the block for `Measure` because it doesn't have sufficient precision, so the real difference may be significantly larger. But even so, a factor of 360-245k is pretty huge. Relying on primitive 64-bit floats and enums makes `Measure` significantly faster.\n\nChances are, instantiating `Units::Measurement` instances won't be a bottleneck in your application, but it and the heap-memory usage (`Units::Measurement` allocates almost 1MB of heap per instance) are factors to consider.\n\n</details>\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
